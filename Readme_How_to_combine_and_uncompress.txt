1. Using 7zip combine the 16 pieces (each piece is ~51MB) of files into one, name it "DisPredict_v1.0.tar.gz"
2. Uncompress "DisPredict_v1.0.tar.gz" using command:  
		tar xvzf DisPredict_v1.0.tar.gz
3. Read the Readme file, found inside folder, and proceed.


Alternative approach:
 1. If available, download the compressed software as a single piece from http://cs.uno.edu/~tamjid/Software/DisPredict/DisPredict_v1.0.tar.gz
    The size of the file is ~801MB.    
 2. Uncompress "DisPredict_v1.0.tar.gz" using command: 
		tar xvzf DisPredict_v1.0.tar.gz 
 3. Read the "ReadMe" file, found inside the folder and then proceed accordingly.
